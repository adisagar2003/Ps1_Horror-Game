## 🕹 Overview
A PS1-inspired survival horror game set deep in a dark, atmospheric forest. As night falls and your tools fail, something ancient awakens. Equipped with only a few repair tools and your instincts, you must navigate the haunted woods, fix your broken equipment, and avoid the creature that hunts you.

Inspired by the lo-fi aesthetic of classic PS1 horror titles, the game blends fixed and free camera angles, procedural animations, eerie sound design, and tense exploration to evoke a strong feeling of unease and immersion.
