![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0732c08a-4835-4ea6-93b5-55b5a8c8d471)

## 🕹 Overview

**Black Factory** is a PS1-inspired survival horror game set in an abandoned factory maze, stalked by a procedurally animated spider. Your goal: find keycards, manage your inventory, restore power, and escape before it finds you.

Inspired by classic lo-fi horror, the game uses low-poly visuals, dynamic lighting, and tension-focused design to deliver a raw survival experience.

## 🔧 Features Implemented

✅ **Inventory System** – Cleanly separated UI & data layers with OOP principles, event-driven item pickup, and refactor-friendly architecture.  
✅ **Objective System** – Track goals like finding keycards, restoring power, and escaping.  
✅ **Event Handling** – Built with Unity events for decoupled systems and responsive gameplay flow.  
✅ **Pickable Inheritance** – Items inherit from a shared base class, enforcing clean code and reusability.  
✅ **Flashlight Drain Mechanic** – Flashlight power depletes, adding tension and resource management.  
✅ **Locked Gates** – Requires keycards to progress, encouraging exploration and item management.  
✅ **Procedurally Animated Spider Enemy** – Uses NavMesh and procedural leg animation to hunt the player dynamically.  
✅ **Shaders & Visual Effects** – Created simple shaders for interactive orbs, x-ray vision mechanic using culling and post-processing control.  
✅ **Basic Perception System** – Enemy perception built to detect and chase the player within a vision cone.  
✅ **Dynamic Post-Processing** – Control environmental effects like vignette, bloom, and scanlines for tension.  
✅ **UI for Instructions & Feedback** – Display objectives, inventory, and player hints cleanly.  
✅ **Built & Shipped on Itch.io and YouTube** – Learned the full pipeline of building, testing, packaging, and shipping a game.
