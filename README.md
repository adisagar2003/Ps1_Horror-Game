![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0732c08a-4835-4ea6-93b5-55b5a8c8d471)

## üïπ Overview

**Black Factory** is a PS1-inspired survival horror game set in an abandoned factory maze, stalked by a procedurally animated spider. Your goal: find keycards, manage your inventory, restore power, and escape before it finds you.

Inspired by classic lo-fi horror, the game uses low-poly visuals, dynamic lighting, and tension-focused design to deliver a raw survival experience.

## üîß Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Inventory System** ‚Äì Cleanly separated UI & data layers with OOP principles, event-driven item pickup, and refactor-friendly architecture.  
‚úÖ **Objective System** ‚Äì Track goals like finding keycards, restoring power, and escaping.  
‚úÖ **Event Handling** ‚Äì Built with Unity events for decoupled systems and responsive gameplay flow.  
‚úÖ **Pickable Inheritance** ‚Äì Items inherit from a shared base class, enforcing clean code and reusability.  
‚úÖ **Flashlight Drain Mechanic** ‚Äì Flashlight power depletes, adding tension and resource management.  
‚úÖ **Locked Gates** ‚Äì Requires keycards to progress, encouraging exploration and item management.  
‚úÖ **Procedurally Animated Spider Enemy** ‚Äì Uses NavMesh and procedural leg animation to hunt the player dynamically.  
‚úÖ **Shaders & Visual Effects** ‚Äì Created simple shaders for interactive orbs, x-ray vision mechanic using culling and post-processing control.  
‚úÖ **Basic Perception System** ‚Äì Enemy perception built to detect and chase the player within a vision cone.  
‚úÖ **Dynamic Post-Processing** ‚Äì Control environmental effects like vignette, bloom, and scanlines for tension.  
‚úÖ **UI for Instructions & Feedback** ‚Äì Display objectives, inventory, and player hints cleanly.  
‚úÖ **Built & Shipped on Itch.io and YouTube** ‚Äì Learned the full pipeline of building, testing, packaging, and shipping a game.
